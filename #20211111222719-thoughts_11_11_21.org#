The idea that you are suffering. Yes you are suffering, but you are not suffering
anything compared to what other peopl before you have suffered. You must consider
your influence on the future. Eventhough you are discouraged by things in life you
just keep going and keep creating, keep expressing yourself. Growing and changing.
Eventhough you came from bad doesnt mean your life can't be good. And maybe it
wasnt that bad. Live with the cards you've been delt. Figure out a way to make it
work. That is the most important thing. Figuring out how to make something work
that wouldn't naturally do so.
