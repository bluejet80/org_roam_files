* Useful Functions
      
** Inputs

*** string.equals("string")
    When you are taking input and want to know if the input is equal to something
    and if it is then you will do this:
 #+begin_src java
   package packagename;
   import java.util.Scanner;
   
   public class Main {
   
       public static void main(String[] args) {
	   Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
	   String name = input.nextLine();
   
	   if (name.equals("Jarett")) {
	       System.out.println("You typed Jarett");
	       }
	   system.out.println("You didn't type Jarett"
       }
   }
 #+end_src

*** |###########################|
    
*** Parsing an input for an integer
    All inputs are taken as strings so if you want to work with an integer that is
    input then you must parse the integer from the input.

#+begin_src java
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // initialize scanner
  String inputStrg = input.nextLine();
  int age = Integer.parseInt(inputStrg); //parse string for int
  
  if (age >= 13) {
      System.out.println("You can ride!");
  } else {
      System.out.println("You connot ride!");
  }
#+end_src

*** |###########################|
    
** Arrays

*** How to setup arrays

#+begin_src java
  
  package packagename;
  
  public class Main {
  
      public static void main(String[] args) {
  
	  String[] newArr = new String[5]; // initialize array with 5 items
	  newArr[0] = "hello";
	  newArr[1] = "hi";
	  newArr[2] = "Jarett";  /// populating the array
	  newArr[3] = "Bill";
	  newArr[4] = "potato";
  
	  String x = newArr[4];
	  System.out.println(x); // prints the 5th item in the "newArr" array
  
	  // other types of arrays
  
	  int[] nums = {2,3,54,63,7};
  
	  double[] nums2 = {3.45, 5.87, 6.73};
  
	  int y = nums[3];
	  System.out.println(y); // prints the 4th item in the "nums" array
  
      }
  }
  
#+end_src

*** |###########################|

** For Loops / Arrays
   For loops are used in instances where you wish to loop a specific amount of times

*** Print a list of numbers with a for loop/ print an array

#+begin_src java
  
  package packagename;
  
  public class Main {
  
      public static void main(String[] args){
  
	  for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
	      System.out.println(i);       // prints out numbers 0-10
	  }
	  for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i+=5) {
	      System.out.println(i);       // prints out numbers 0,5,10
	  }
	  int[] arr = {1,5,7,3,6,12,40}; // initialized array
  
	  for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
	      System.out.println(arr[i]);  // prints the values in the array
  
	      if (arr[i] == 5) {
		  System.out.println("Found a 5!");   // prints only when it finds a 5
	      }
	  }
      }
  }
#+end_src

*** |###########################|

*** Easier way to print out elements in an array

#+begin_src java
  public static void main(String[] args){
  
      int[] arr = {4,5,3,7,21,44};
      String[] names = new String[5];
  
      for (int element:arr) { //assigns each item in the array to "element" variable
	  System.out.println(element);  // prints the values in the array
      }
  
      int count = 0;
      for (int element:arr) {
	  System.out.println(element + " " + count); // print value and index
	  count++;
      }
  }
  
#+end_src

*** |###########################|

*** Build an Array through inputs

#+begin_src java
  
    public static void main(String[] args){
  
	int[] arr = {4,5,3,7,21,44};
	String[] names = new String[5];  // Array length of 5
	Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  
	for (int i = 0; i > names.length; i++) {
  
	    System.out.print("Input: ");  // ask for input, user will type name, 
	    String strInput = input.nextLine();  // continues to ask for input until end of array is hit.
	    if (strInput.equals("quit")) {     // if user types "quit" before the end of the array
		break;                      //the loop will break and "quit" will not be added to array.
	    }
	    names[i] = strInput;  // puts the input into the array
	}
  
	for (String n:names) {
	    System.out.println(n);  // then prints out items in array
	}
  }
  
#+end_src

*** |###########################|

** While Loops
   While loops are used when you dont know how many times you will be looping
   
*** Keep looping until they type the number 10

 #+begin_src java
   
   package packagename;
   import java.util.Scanner;
   
   public class Main {
   
       public static void main(String[] args) {
   
	   Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // creating a scanner object
	   System.out.print("Type a number: ");
	   int x = input.nextInt();
   
	   int count = 0;
	   while (x != 10) {    /// keeps looping until user types 10
	      System.out.print("Type 10... ");
	      System.out.print("Type a number: ");
	      x = input.nextInt();
	      count++;     // increments count each time.
	   }
	   System.out.println("You typed 10!");
	   System.out.println("It took you " + count + " tries.");
       }
   }
   
 #+end_src
*** |###########################|
    
*** More condensed version with a "Do While Loop"
#+begin_src java
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
  
      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
      int x;
  
      do {
	 System.out.print("Type a number: ");
	 x = input.nextInt();
      } while (x != 10);
  }
  
#+end_src

** Sets and Lists
   Sets and lists are pretty complicated so we need to research them more.
   Here is a quick introduction.
   With Sets and lists you dont have to specify how big they are before hand.
   They just take inputs and grow or shrink accordingly.

*** Sets
    A set is a collection of unordered objects that are UNIQUE.
    It cannot contain the same element twice and it doesn't know where it exists.
    If you try to add the same element to the set it doesnt care and skips it.
    Sets are very fast.

**** HashSet

#+begin_src java
  
  package packagename;
  import java.util.HashSet;
  import java.util.Set;
  
  public class Main {
  
      public static void main(String[] args) {
  
	  Set<Integer> t = new HashSet<Integer>(); // creating a HashSet object
	  t.add(5);
	  t.add(7);
	  t.add(13);  /// adding integers to set
	  t.add(45);
  
	  t.contains(13); // will return a boolean
  
	  t.remove(7); // removes "7" from set
  
	  t.clear(); // clears the entire set
	  t.isEmpty(); // returns a boolean
	  t.size(); // gives you the length of the set
  
  
      }
  }
  
#+end_src

**** TreeSet
     Similar to HashSet where you can only have unique elements.
     However Now the elements are ordered in a tree data structure

**** Linked HashSet
     Linked HashSets are similar to HashSets but faster with certain operations.
*** |###########################|        
     
*** Lists
    An ArrayList is similar to a regualar array but it is slower, but
    it will grow and shrink as needed.
    Items are indexed. Items do not need to be unique. 
    Similar functions to "Sets" with a few different ones.

**** ArrayList
    
#+begin_src java
  
  package packagename;
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  
  public class Main {
  
      public static void main(String[] args) {
  
	  ArrayList<Integer> t = new ArrayList<Integer>();
	  t.add(1); // added at index 0
	  t.add(2); // added at index 1
	  t.get(0);
	  t.set(1, 5) // (index, value) Changes value at index
	      // To be able to set, there already has to be something
	      // at that index
	  t.subList(1, 3); // gets values from index 1 to index 3, [not including 3]
  
  
  
      }
  }
  
#+end_src

**** LinkedList
     Similar to ArrayLists but faster. Somthing else to be researched

* Java Static methods
  In Java, a static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than
  an instance of a class. A static method is not part of the objects it creates
  but is part of a class definition. Unlike instance methods, a static method
  is referenced by the class name and can be invoked without creating an object
  of the class.

  Info about Variables, datatypes, syntax & compilaton and execution

** Compilation and execution
   When you compile all the source code in the source, the compiler produces
   one .class file for each .java file. The .class contains the compiled version of the .java file.

   To compile all the classes within your project you will run the code below:
   
   "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin\javac" src/myfirstapp/*.java -d classes

   The first part is the java compiler, the second part is the folder which contains
   your src directory. The *.java tell the compiler to compile all the files.
   The -d creates a classes directory.

   Once the compiler is done the classes directory will contain all the compiled .class files.
   The package structure of the src folder will be preserved in the class directory.
   Now you can run any of the .class files which contain a main() method.
   Running the file from the command line will look like this:

    "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin\java" -cp classes myfirstapp.MyJavaApp

    The -cp classes flag tells the JVM that all your classes are located in the dir
    classes. This is also called the "class path".

    The name of the class to run is the last argument in the above command [myfirstapp.MyJavaApp]
    The JVM needs to know the fully qualified class name (all packages plus class name) to determine
    where the corresponding .class file is located.
    
** Variables and Data Types

*** Declaring a variable
    data_type variable_name = value;
    
*** Types of Variables

**** Local variable
     These variables are declared inside a method of the class. Their scope is limited
     to the method, which means that You can not change their values and or access them
     outside of the method

**** Static(or Class) Variable
     Static variables are also known as class variables because they are associated with the
     class and common for all the instances of class.
     For Example: If I create three objects of a class and access this static variable, it
     would be common for all, the changes made to the variable by one object, would reflect
     when you access it through other objects.
     You can also access the static variables without using the objects.
     No other variable can be accessed like that. 

**** Instance Variable
     Each Instance(object) of a class has its own copy of instance variables.
     Unlike static variables, instance variables have their own unique copy of
     the instance variable. 

*** Java Data Types

**** Data type defines the value that a variable can take

**** Various Data Types

***** Primitive Data Types

***** Other Data Types

** Operators
*** Types of Operators

**** Basic Arithmetic Operators

**** Assignment Operators
***** num2 = num1
***** num2 += num1
      adds the numbers and assigns the value to num2
***** num2 /= num1
      divides the numbers and assigns the value to num2
***** 

**** Auto-Increment/decrement Operators
***** num2 ++
      increments num2 by one 

**** Logical Operators
***** b1&&b2
      'And' operator - returns true if both are true
***** b1||b2
      'Or' operator - returns true if one or the other are true
***** !b1
      'Not' operator - returns true if not b1

**** Comparison (relational) operators
***** There are six relational operators
      ==, !=, <, >, >=, >=

**** Bitwise Operators
***** There are six bitwise operators
      &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
***** Bitwise operator performs bit by bit processing 
***** num1 | num2
      compares corresponding bits of num1 and num2 and generates 1 if either
      bit is 1, else returns 0
***** num1 ^ num2
      This compares corresponding bits of num1 and num2 and generates 1
      if they are not equal, else it returns 0 
***** ~num1
      This is a complement operator that just changes the bit from 1 to 0 
***** num1 << 1
      This is a left shift operator that moves the bits to the left,
      discards the far left bit, and assigns the rightmost bit to 0
      The number of bits is determined by the number on the right side of
      the operaotor
***** num1 >> 1
      Same as above except moves the bit to the right

**** Ternary Operators
***** This operator evaluates a boolean expression and assigns the value based on the result
      Syntax: variable num1 = (expression) ? value if true: value otherwise

*** Operator Precedence in Java
    This determines which operator needs to be evaluated first if an
    expression has more than one operator. 

** Statements
   When we need to execute a set of statements based on a condition
   then we need to use control flow statements

*** If-else Statement

**** The If Statement
     The "If" statement gets executed only when the given condition is true.
     If the condition is false then it skips the statement and continues to the
     code after it. 
**** Nested if statement
     An if statement inside an if statement is called a nested if statement.
     The first statement would execute if condition_1 is true.
     The second Statement would only execute if both the conditionals are true.
**** If else Statement
     Here the statement inside the "if" statement would execute if the condition is true, and
     the statements inside the "else" statement would execute if the condition is false. 
**** if-else-if statement
     This is kindof like a switch statement.
     If-else-if statement is used when we need to check multiple conditions.
     This statement always begins with an "if" statement and ends with an "else"
     statement with "if-else" statements in between.

     Sample Code:
     
 #+begin_src java
   
   if(condition_1 ) {
       statement(s);
   }
   else if(condition_2){
       statement(s);
   }
   else{
       statement(s);
   }
   
 #+end_src     

     
*** Switch-case Statement
    Switch statements are used when we have a number of options(or choices)
    and we may need to perform a different task for each choice.

    Make sure that you include a break statement or the switch will
    just continue on after the first choice is made.

    1. Case doesnt always have to have an order, you can specify them in
    any order based on the requirement.
    2. Characters can also be used in a switch statement
    3. The expression given inside switch should result in a constant value
       otherwise it will not be valid.
    4. Nesting of switch statements are allowed, which means you can have switch
       inside another switch statement. However this should be avoided because
       it make the program more complex and less readable.

       Example Code:

  #+begin_src java
    
    public class Switch1 {
	public static void main(String args[]){
	    int i = 2
	    switch(i) {
	      case 1:
		System.out.println("Case1");
		break;
	      case 2:
		System.out.println("Case2");
		break;
	      case 3:
	        System.out.println("Case3");
		break;
	      default:
		System.out.println("Default");
	    }	
	}
    
    }
    
 #+end_src
    
*** Java Loops
    Loops are used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a
    particular condition is satisfied. 

**** For Loop

     Example Syntax:
 #+begin_src java
   for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
       statement(s);
   }
   
 #+end_src

     First Step: In the loop, initialization happens first and only
     one time.

     Second Step: Condition in for loop is evaluated on each itereation,
     if the condition is true then the statements inside the for loop
     body get executed. Once the condition returns false, the loop is exited.

     Third Step: After every execution the counter that was initialized is
     incremented or decremented

     Fourth Step: The Condition is checked and if true the body statements
     executed again. 

**** While Loop

**** Do-While Loop

*** Java Continue Statement

*** Java Break Statement

  
** Classes + Objects
   
   The first letter of a java class is usually capitalized.
   
   Classes group variables and operations together in coherent modules. A class can have fields,
   constructors, and methods and more.

   Objects are instances of classes. When you create an object that object-type is of a certain class.
   The Class can be seen as a template(or Blueprint) telling how objects of a class will look.

   Example Class

#+begin_src java
  
  public class Car {
  
  }
  
#+end_src

*** Fields

    A field is a variable that belongs to a class or an object. It is a piece of data.
    For example: a Car class could define the field brand which all Car objects would have.
    Each car object could have a different value for the brand field.

    [[http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/fields.html][more info]]

 #+begin_src java
  
   public class Car {
       private string brand; //field
  
   }
  
 #+end_src

   

*** Constructors

    Constructors are a special kind of method that is executed when an object of that class is created.
    Constructors typically initialize the objects internal fields.

    [[http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/constructors.html][More info]]

 #+begin_src java
  
   public class Car {
  
       private String brand;
  
       public Car(String theBrand) { //this is the constructor
	   this.brand = theBrand;
      }
   }
  
 #+end_src 

*** Methods
   
    Methods are groups of operations tha carry out a certain function together. They are used
    to group operations together, that you need to be able to execute from several different places.

 #+begin_src java
  
   public class Car {
  
       private String brand;
  
       public Car(String theBrand) {
	   this.brand = theBrand;
      }
   }

*** Interfaces

    Interfaces are a central concept in Java.
    An Interface describes what methods a cretain object should have available to it.
    A class can implement an interface.
    When a class implements an interface, the class has to implement all the methods described in the interface.

*** Packages

    A package is a directory containing Java Classes and interfaces. Packages make it possible to
    group related classes and interfaces, thus making modularization of your java code easier.

**** Package Naming Conventions

     Java packages are always written in lower case letters.

     To avoid creating packages with the same names as other public Java Packages it
     is recommended that you start your package hierarchy with the reverse domain name
     of your company. Imagine that your company is jarett.com. The hierarchy would run:
     com - jarett - package name

**** Importing Classes from other Java Packages
     If a class A needs to use class B, you will need to reference class B inside class A.
     If both the classes are inside the same package then it will look as follows:
-----------------------
 #+begin_src java
     
   public class B {
   
       public void doIt() {
	   // do something...
       }
   }
#+end_src
---------------------
#+begin_src java
       
  public class A {
  
      public static void main(String[] args){
	  B theBObj = new B();
  
	  theBObj.doIt();
      }
  }
 #+end_src
---------------------
