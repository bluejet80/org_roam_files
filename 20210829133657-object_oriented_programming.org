#+title: Object Oriented Programming

This is a place for everything Object Oriented Programming related.

* Object Oriented Programming
  In object oriented programming you have full control over the names of the classes and methods.
  Your goal is to make your code as readable as possible. To organize it in the most simplest fashion. 
  To not have any thing that is not necessary and understand how everything in the program relates to
  everything else. 
** Methods should only do one thing. 
** Make sure to keep things private and only make public what is necessary.
** Use methods to hide the underworkings of the code.
