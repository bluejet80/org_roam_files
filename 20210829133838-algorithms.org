* Recursive Problems
  
** Five steps to solving any recursive problem

*** 1. What is the simplest possible input

**** What if one or all inputs are zero?

**** It is from this that we will develop our base cases. 

*** 2. Play around with examples and visualize

**** Dont be afraid to write out a ton of examples
     This is so you can be able to see a pattern develop

*** 3. Relate complex examples to more simple ones

*** 4. Generalize the pattern
