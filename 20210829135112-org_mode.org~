* Org-Roam
** 8/30/21
  So I thought I had a problem but it was all just about how I invoked the program.
  I was using an emacs method to invoke org-roam and for org-roam to work
  initially *it* must be invoked. So the resolution was to instead of searching
  for the first file to be edited with emacs I search for the first file to
  be edited with org-roam and that fixed everything.

  I spent several hours trying to find the solution to my problem on the internet
  to no avail. I realize now its because it wasn't a problem at all, more of an
  issue of invoking the program wrong. It was very frustrating because everything
  else was working fine and once I created a link it would work fine. I kept trying
  to get the program to initialize itself and I even set-up a key binding that I would
  run after I restarted emacs to reinvoke it when all I should have done was
  *correctly invoke the program to begin with.* That means using C-c n f to find the
  first file to edit instead of C-x C-f (the emacs way).

  Now I know. And I also realize how a simple mistake can cause me great anxiety
  and stress. And cause me to lose several hours of productivity. It happens to
  everyone I'm sure.

  
** 11/5/21
   I finnally got org-roam to work on the server. I had to get emacs 27 installed
   first. And then I was having issues with it not recognizing the org-roam files
   already present in the folder.

   I learned that all the configuration files are in the melpa directory, inside
   the .emacs.d folder. I went into that folder and removed everything that had to
   do with org-roam. The sql-lite database files were in there and everything.
   Removed all that, then I removed the configuration in the init file for org-roam.
   After that I be;gan the rebuild. I setup a new folder for the org-roam files,
   I put a more consise version of the org-roam init script into the init file.
   Then I evaluated the buffer and at first there were some problems because I
   need to update the package list from melpa. After doing that the sql-lite
   file was compiled and everything was good there. Now I needed to get it to recognize
   the files that I had transfered over from my other computer. To do this I
   first ran _org-roam-update-id-locations_, not sure if that did anything or not
   cause it wasnt until I ran _org-roam-db-sync_ that it finnally recognized the files.

   I have been trying to get this going for a while now it seems. Feels go to have
   finnally got it all setup. And its good to know if something happens and I need
   to reinstall everything. as long as I have the org-roam-files I can get everything
   back the way it was. Now I am going to try to only alter the org-roam files on
   the server. This is because I'm not sure how to keep track of the changes I make
   locally or on the server.

   The next thing I would like to get running is the graph display, this will show
   how each node is connected to other nodes.
