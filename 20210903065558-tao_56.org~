Number 56

Those who know do not tell,
Those who tell do not know,
Not to set the toungue loose
But to curb it,
Not to have edges that catch
But to remain untangled,
Unblinded,
Unconfused,
Is to find balance,
And he who holds balance beyond sway of love or hate,
Beyond reach of profit or los,
Beyond care of praise or blame,
Has attained the highest post in the world.
