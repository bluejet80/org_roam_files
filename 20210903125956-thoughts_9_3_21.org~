I'm trying to think of what I was going to type.

So often I wish for something else, but then I realize that my life
is exactly how I want it to be. And if I was anywhere else I would
just wish I was back here. But the mind longs for somehting else
constantly. Its part of those things that we must learn to control.
There are good and bad voices within our minds and too often it is
the negative influence that is heard over the positive influence.
We have to work to disregard that which we shouldn't do and work to
seek out that which we should do. I guess that is the univereses
tendency towards chaos and entropy. Organization, dicipline always
comes with a challenge.

Sacrificing is a way of overcomming these things. The best answer always
is to do without. It has become a way within my mind of getting back
at those voices that I wish to ignore. I just don't do anything.
If there is a desire that arizes within me then I purposefully dont
fulfill it. Its like if you are asking the question of should you
do it, then the answer is no. If it is not a necessity, then you don't
need it.
