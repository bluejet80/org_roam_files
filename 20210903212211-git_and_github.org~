*** Setting up your SSH Key
   SSH KEY
   To generate a key type
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

   The passphrase is afterlife1980
   the location of the key will be in the \home dir.
   c\home\.ssh

   Then you have to start the ssh-agent in the background
   run:
   $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   Agent pid 1625

   then add your ssh key to the ssh-agent

   $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

   Now you have to add the public key to GitHub
   to copy the public key to the clipboard type
   
   $ clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

   then go to Git hub and add the SSH key to your profile.

   After you have copyied the key and added it to your
   profile then test the connection by typing

   $ ssh -T git@github.com

   The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.114.4)' can't be established.
  RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
  This key is not known by any other names
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
  Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
  Hi bluejet80! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

  Success!!

  Now we can do a git Push

  make sure you are in the directory of the repository on your computer
  then type 
  git push origin main


   
   
*** Need to setup two factor authentication to get ssh links to work

** Git Commands
   clone - Bring a repository that is hosted on GitHub into a folder
           on your local machine

	   $ git clone https://github.com/bluejet80/first-repo.git

	   This was the http method
	   I got the link from the repository on github where I created it.

	   The ssh method will look a little different

   add - Track you files and changes in Git

   commit - Save your files in Git

   push - Upload Git commits to a remote repo, like GitHub

   pull - Download changes from a remote repo to your local machine

   status - shows the changes made

*** Check Status
   once you make changes to your files then you can run the git status
   command and see the status of the files

   $ git status
  On branch main
  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

  Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

  Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Index.html

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

  Here we can clearly see what files are tracked and which ones are not.

*** Add files   
  If we are done making changes then we want to add all the files in the
  directory to the git tracking system

  we do this by typing git add .
  the preiod adds all files in the directory

  Now if we run the status again we see

  $ git status
  On branch main
  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

  Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   Index.html
        modified:   README.md

*** Commit files
  Now we will commit these changes with the commit command

  The first time you run the commit command you may have to identify yourself.

  $ git commit -m "Made Some Changes" -m "Added Index.html and added a new heading in README.md"
   Author identity unknown

    Please tell me who you are.

   Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

   to set your account's default identity.
   Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

   fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'Jarett@Lenova-Yoga.(none)')

   Once you do those things then you can run it again and should get these results.

   $ git commit -m "Made Some Changes" -m "Added Index.html and added a new heading in README.md"
   [main ceb10df] Made Some Changes
   2 files changed, 8 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
   create mode 100644 Index.html

*** Push the files up to GitHub
   Now you are ready to push the changes up to GitHub with the command

   git push origin main
   

   
*** To pull down changes and apply them
    If you are still in the directory of the repository
    Just run

    git pull origin main

    
*** To create a git repository from a local folder
    You just have to cd into that folder in the terminal
    and then type
    $ git init -b <branch_name>

    This establishes this folder as a git repository
    then you just have to add the files, commit them.

    Then before you can push it up to github you must first
    create a new empty repository on github and then copy the ssh
    link that they give you for it.
    Then you have to run

    $ git remote add origin <link>

    to check to see if its available just run

    $ git remote -v

    And it will list the repository

    Now you will be able to push the repository up to github like normal

    There is another part where you setup an uptream...
