Parts of the Process

1. Make your requirements less dumb
2. Delete the part or process that is unnecessary
   If you are not adding things back in 10% of the time
   You are clearly not deleting enough
3. Simplify and Optimize
   The most common mistake of a smart engineer is to optimize somthing
   that should not exist.
4. Accelerate Cycle time
5. Automate
