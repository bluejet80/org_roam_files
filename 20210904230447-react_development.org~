#+title: React Development

This is where information on React will go.

The tutorial that I am currently watching is
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0][video link]]

It teaches and shows you how to make a mobile application

when you build a user interface with React you are
building a bunch of independent, isolated and reuseable components.

The component is a central idea in react.js development.

Each application has at least one component. This is the root componenet.
This root componenet also contains all the other child components.

Every react applicaiton is built in this tree hierarchy.

Example code of a component:

#+begin_src java script
  
  class Tweet {
      state = {};
  
      render() {
      }
  }
  
#+end_src


* Setup

  The Tutorial is using create-react-app version 1.5.2, current version is 4.0.3

** To run react we need to have Node.js installed
   Then run this command in the terminal

   npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2

   they also want you to have visual studio code

   And they have you install extensions in VS code.

   2. Prettier code formatter

   Enable formatting on save within VS Code

* Begin Creating your first app

** create a file filename.jsx
   the extension jsx is used to give you more code completion options
  This file is created within the Compoenets directory inside the
  src folder.

** the first thing you must do is import React

#+begin_src java script
  
  import React, { Component } from 'react';
  
  class | Counter extends Component {
      state = {}
	render() {
  
  
      }
  }
  
  export default Counter;
  
#+end_src
   
   That is the first iteration:
   Some things can be simplified to get this result:

   
#+begin_src java script
  
  import React, { Component } from 'react';
  
  export default class | Counter extends Component {
	  render() {
	  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
      }
  }
  
#+end_src
