There are four environments of memory.

* The Forest

** Description
   This is a place filled with things. There is stuff everywhere.
   Every patch of the ground is inhabited by some animal
   There are trees and shrubs and plants, everywhere
   You get through it all by making a path as best that you can.
   There is a risk of getting lost, of losing your direction
   Falling into a trap.
   

** The various associations
   
*** A fallen tree
*** A large old tree
*** Paths
*** A deer
*** A snake
*** A bird
*** A beatle
*** An ant
*** A small pond
*** Im in the forest Im gonna make wooden objects from the trees
*** Im gonna take shelter from the storm beneith the canopy
*** 

* The Mountain

** Description
   This is a place where the ground is solid granite. The wind blows hard.
   There are few trees here. There are some birds. There are goats and
   mountain lions. The ground is steep sometimes. You climb to get around.
   There is a risk of falling off the side. You have a good sense of
   direction from the surrounding area. You can see for miles.
   It's quite lucky to find an unoccupied cave. 

** The various acssociations

* The Ocean

* The Desert
