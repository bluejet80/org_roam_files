#+title: Common lisp code
#+date: [2021-09-21 Tue 16:55]


* Creating a database
  
** Create the global variable that will reference the database
#+begin_src lisp
  
  (defvar *db* nil)
  
#+end_src
  
** Define a function for making the records

#+begin_src lisp
  
  (defun make-rec (name address date items return)
    (list :name name :address address :date date :items items :return return))
  
#+end_src 

** Create a function to add the records to the database
   This uses the builtin PUSH macro

#+begin_src lisp
  
  (defun add-rec (rec) (push rec *db*))
  
  ;; this needs to be further abstracted because we are still
  ;; having to run two functions
  
  (defun add (a b c d e)
	   (add-rec (make-rec a b c d e)))
  
  ;; Now all we must do is type
  
  (add "name" "address" "date" items(number) return[T/F])
  
#+end_src

** To show a list of database entries

#+begin_src lisp
  
  cl-user> *db*
  
  ;; but we want to have our information presented in a
  ;; nice fasion so we will create a function for that.
  
  (defun dump-db ()
    (dolist (rec *db*)
      (format t "岷卑酤狺%" rec)))
  
  ;; another way to do this in less space would be
  
  (defun dump-db ()
    (format t "岷卑酤狺%}" *db*))
  
#+end_src  

** Adding user input to the database
   Now we will make a function to get user input to create
   the records of the database.
   
#+begin_src lisp
  
  ;; first we must define the prompt for information
  
  (defun prompt-read (prompt)
    (format *query-io* "a: " prompt)
    (force-output *query-io*)
    (read-line *query-io*))
  
  ;; now we will combine the prompt funtion with the make-rec
  ;;function to make our full function
  
  (defun prompt-for-rec ()
    (make-rec
     (prompt-read "Name")
     (prompt-read "Address")
     (prompt-read "Date")
     (or (parse-integer (prompt-read "Items") :junk-allowed t) 0)
     (y-or-n-p "Return Cust [y/n]: ")))
   
#+end_src

** Finnally we can add a function that loops for more inputs
   With this function we will wrap the prompt-for-rec function in
   a function that loops until the user is done.

#+begin_src lisp
  
  (defun add-recs ()
    (loop (add-rec (prompt-for-rec))
	  (if (not (y-or-n-p "Another? [y/n]: ")) (return))))
  
#+end_src

** Now we need to save the database file

#+begin_src lisp
  
  (defun save-db (filename)
    (with-open-file (out filename
			 :direction :output
			 :if-exists :supersede)
      (with-standard-io-syntax
	(print *db* out))))
  
#+end_src

  You can save the file as anything really.
  example: Customer.db

  
   
** This is the code to then load the Database

** 
** 
** end

#+begin_src lisp
#+end_src

* Creating a Evolving Simulation
