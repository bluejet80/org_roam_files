The point is
the important thing is
to develop your process of adaptation instead of
trying to prevent some one thing from happening.
If you spend all this time trying to prevent something from happening
and in the end something else equally as devestating happens and
you are unable to recover, unable to adapt.

Ona small scale. In our everyday lives. Lets try to adapt as much as possible
to the environment. Instead of forcing the environment to bow to our will.
Specifically pertaining to individual psychology.

now if the same idea is implemented on a societal level, the effects can be
devastating to both the individual and the environment.

The process of adaptation, the process of evolution is what should be studied
How do you increase the rate of evolution? How can you learn more and go farther?
What happens if you advance faster than your environment?
What happens if you overrun your resources?

there must be three things...

there is the individual
there is the environment
there is the collective consciousness that pervades spirit and matter
