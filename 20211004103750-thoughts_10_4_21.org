I want to think of programs that I can write to do one thing or another.

* Program that will have a conversation with you

** Asking questions changes the topic 

** Affirmations or Negations direct conversation

** It could be like a tutor.
   You ask it a question and it tells you the answer
   You ask it to tell you about this thing and you get
   a random thought about it. 

** The program knows what the subject is
   Stays on subject until you act disinterested


   
* Program that will write a short story

** Similar to the conversation program

** What are the Components that are necessary?

*** Subjects

**** Attitudes/ Personalites

*** Actions

**** Good and Bad

**** positive / negative

**** supportive / destructive of the plot

*** Places

**** My Favorite places

**** Interesting places

*** Plots

**** A finite number of sequences

**** Twists

** How long will each story be?

*** Introduction

*** Plot line

*** Ending



    
* Program that will turn my journal entry into a webpage

** Org mode already does this to an extent
   but I want to customize it more

** What are the different compoenets that will be necessary?



   
* Elaborate on the text game program

** Continue to go through the book 

** develop a better user interface




   
* The program that paints images on the window

** Using characters
   maybe the brightness of the characters, or the character
   itself could control the brightness.
   which character is the brightest, which is the darkest
   
** How big is the canvas size

** Can you write animation into it



   
* A program to calculate something

** Something that I couldn't possible calculate on my own..
** The number of times I wish I'd talked to the girl
** Going to mars would be the same as driving to your house how many times...
** The pressure exerted on my heart by your sweet smile is...
** How much light is necessary to eliminate all the shadows?
   To make sure and reach all the shadows you would have to destroy the surfaces
   that the light hits first. 
** Why aren't there more numbers in my life?
** If math is everywhere why can't I find it?
** You could associate everything with a number
   But it would have no significant connection to the thing
   How does this number represent this chair?
   Is it its dimension? Its placement in the room? The number of parts that it has?
   The year it was made? Its relationship to the wall and other things in the room?
** How many hours can I spend on studying?
   Progress is not measurede in hours alone. Sure you need time but a lot can
   be accomplished in a little amount of time and hardly anything can happen
   over large spans of time. Everything happens in its own time.
   But you have to atleast be walking in a certain direction if you
   wish to get to a certain place. You cannot determine when you will arrive
   but you can point yourself in the right direction.
