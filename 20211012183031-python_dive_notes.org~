Setup a directory:
  C:\Users\Jarett\dev

  Where I will put all the python programs that I write from this book.

* First Program
  The book starts off by having you write a pretty advanced program with
  all the correct annotations and exception handeling as well.

  I will detail the info below:

  I am writing the program in The Spyder Python IDE

  The program is called humansize.py

  This program/script defines a single function, the approximate_size() function.
  This function takes an exact file size in bytes and calculates a pretty
  (but approximate) size.

  Towards the bottom of the script you'll see two calls to
  print(approximate_size(arguments))

  These are function calls that call the approximate_size() function and pass
  a number of arguments; then take the return value and pass it straight to
  the print() function.

  First we will look deeper into the approximate_size function
  

  
** Approximate_size Function
   Python has functions like most languages, but it doesn't have separate header
   files like C++ or interface/implementation sections like Pascal.
   When you need a function you just declare it.

   def function_name(args)

   The keyword def starts the function declaration, followed by the funciton
   name, and then followed by the arguments in parentheses. Multiple arguments
   are separated by commas.
   Note that the function does not define a return datatype. Python functions
   do not specify the datatype of their return value; they dont even specify
   whether they return a value. But, in fact, every Python function returns
   a value. If it executes a return statement then it returns that value,
   otherwise, it will return None, the Python null value.

   The approximante_size() function take the two arguments size and
   a_kilobyte_is_1024_bytes, but neither argument specifies a datatype.
   In Python, variables are never explicitly typed. Python figures out
   what type a variable is an keeps track of it internally.

   
** The if __name__ = "__main__" block
   Python files are called Modules and they are identified by the .py file
   extension. A module can define functions, classes, and variables.

   So when the interpretor runs a module, the __name__ variable will be
   set as __main__ if the module that is being run in the main program.

   But if the code is importing the module from another module, then the
   __name__ variable will be set to that module's name.

   Basically you use the if __name__ = "__main__" block to allow or
   prevent parts of code from being run when modules are imported. 
   
   
** Optional and Named Arguments
   Python allows function arguments to have default values; if the function is
   called without the argument, the argument gets its default value.
   Furthermore, arguments can be specified in any order by using named arguments.

   In our function declaration, the second argument specifies a default value
   a_kilobyte_is_1024_bytes=True

   This means that the argument is optional.

   Now looking back at the bottom of the script, the first function call
   specifies the second argument as False and the second function call
   leaves it out entirely so it defaults to True.
   
*** Function parameters by name

    If you were to run the approximate_size() function and reverse the order
    of the arguments passed, it would still run fine, that is if the second
    argument is named. If the arguments are passed in a different order than
    specified and not named then the script will return an error. Also, as
    soon as you name an argument, all the following arguments need to be
    named aswell.

    
** Writing Readable Code
   Code is written once, but read many times. And the most important audience
   for your code is the future you(six months later after you've forgotten
   what the hell the function actually does)
   Python makes it easy to write readable code.

   
*** Document Strings
    You can document a Python function by giving it a document string(docstring).
    In this program, the approximate_size() function has a docstring.

    Tripple quotes signifies a multiline string. Everything between the start
    and end quotes is part of a single string.

    The functions docstring documents what the function does.
    A docstring must be the first thing defined in a funciton(on the next line
    after the function declaration). One added feature of having a docstring
    is that they are available at runtime as an attribute of the function.

    Many Python IDE's use docstrings to provide context-sensitive documentation.
    So when you type the function name, the docstring appears as a tooltip.

    
** The import Search Path
   Python looks in several places when you try to import a module. Specifically,
   it looks in all the directories defined in sys.path.

   To view the sys.path listing you will type:
   >>> import sys
   >>> sys.path

   ['C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\python38.zip',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\DLLs',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\lib',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3',
 '',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\locket-0.2.1-py3.8.egg',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\win32',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\win32\\lib',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\Pythonwin',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\IPython\\extensions',
 'C:\\Users\\Jarett\\.ipython']

   You can add a new directory to Python's search path at runtime by adding
   the directory name to sys.path.
   By using sys.path.insert(0, new_path), you inserted a new directory as the
   first item of the sys.path list (and therefore at the beginning of python's
   search path) This is almost always what you want. In case of naming conflicts,
   it ensures that your modules will be found and used instead of the modules
   that came with python.

   
** Everything is an Object
   Python functions have attributes and those attibutes are available at runtime.
   Like everything else in python, a function is an object.

   To access the approximate_size() function in the console we would type:
   
   >>> import humansize

   >>> print(humansize.approximate_size(4096, True))
   4.0 KiB

   >>> print(humansize.approximate_size.__doc__)

    Convert a file size to human-readable form.
    
    Keyword arguments:
    size -- file size in bytes
    a_kilobyte_is_1024_bytes -- if True (default), use multiples of 1024
                                if False, use multiples of 1000
                                
    Returns: string

   
    The first line imports the humansize program as a module, a chunck of code
    that you can use interactively, or you can now use it in a larger python
    program. After you import a module, you can reference any of its public
    functions, classes, or attributes.

    To use functions defined in imported modules, you need to include the module
    name. Similarly to how you access methods inside java classes. By calling
    the __doc__ attribute we get the docstring of the function returned. 
    
*** What is an Object
    Everything in Python is an object, and everything can have attributes and
    methods. All functions have a built-in attribute __doc__ which returns
    the docstring.

    You may have heard the term first-class object in other programming contexts.
    In python, functions are first-class objects. You can pass a function as
    the argument to another function. Modules are also first-class objects.
    You can pass an entire module as an argument to a function. Classes are
    first-class objects as well, and individual instances of a class are also
    first-class objects.

    Everything in python is an object. Strings are objects, Lists are objects.
    Functions, classes and class instances, and even modules are objects.

    
** Indenting Code
    Python fyunctions have no explicit beginning or end, and no curly braces
    to mark where the function code starts and stops. The only delimiter is
    a colon(:) and the indentation of the code itself. 
   
*** Code Blocks are defined by their indentation.
    Whitespace is significant in python and must be consistent. The first
    line that is not indented marks the end of the function.
    A completely blank line doesn't count however. They can make the code
    more readable, but they dont count as code block delimiters. The
    function continues on to the next line.
    
** Exceptions
   Exceptions are everywhere in Python. Python will raise them in various
   different circumstances. Well what is an exception? Usually, its an
   error, an indication that something went wrong.
   Some programming languages encourage the use of error return codes which
   you check. Python encourages the use of exceptions, which you handle.

   When an error occurs in the Python shell, it prints out some details
   about the exception and how it happened, and that's it. This is called
   an unhandled exception. When the exception was raised, there was no
   code to explicitly notice it and deal with it, so it bubbled its way
   back to the top level of the Python Shell, which spits out some
   debugging info and calls it a day. In the shell, its no big deal, but
   if it happened while your actual program was running, the entire
   program would come screeching to a halt, if nothing handles the
   exception.

   Unlike Java, Python functions don't declare which exceptions they
   might raise. Its up to you to determine what possible exceptions you
   need to catch.

   Exceptions dont have to result with the program crashing. Exceptions
   can be handled. Sometimes an exception happens because you have a bug
   in your code, but sometimes an exception is something you can anticipate.
   If you are opening a file, it might not exist. If you are importing a
   module, it might not be installed. If you are connecting to a database,
   it might be unavailable, or you might not have the correct security
   credentials to access it.

   If you know that a line of code might raise an exception, you should
   handle the exception using a try...except block

   Python uses try...except blocks to handle exceptions and the raise
   statement to generate them. Java and C++ use try...catch blocks to
   handle exceptions and the throw statement to generate them.

   The approximate_size() function raises exceptions in two different cases:
   If a given size is larger than the function is designed to handle or if
   it's less than zero.

   The syntax for raising an exception is simple enough.
   
   Use the raise statement, followed by the exception name, and an optional
   human-readable string for debugging purposes.
   
   The syntax is reminiscent of calling a function. (In reality, exceptions
   are implemented as classes, and this raise statement is actually creating
   an instance of the ValueError class and passing the string 'number
   must be non-negative' to its initialization method.)

   You dont have to handle exceptions in the function that raises it. If one
   function doesn't handle it, the exception is passed to the calling
   function, then to that function's calling function, and so on, up the
   stack.

   If the exception is never handled, your program will crash. When your
   program crashes, python will print a block of debugging info called a
   traceback, and that's the end of that. Again, maybe that is what you want;
   it all depends on what your program does.

   
** Catching Import Errors
   One of Python's built-in exceptions in ImportError, which is raised when you
   try to import a module and fail. This can happen for a variety of reasons,
   but the simplest case is when the module doesn't exist in your import search
   path.

   This can be used to add optional features into your program. For example:
   Perhaps your program wants to use the chardet library if it exist, but
   continue on gracefully if the user hasn't installed it. You could do this
   with a try....except block.

   try:
     import chardet
   except ImportError:
     chardet = None

   Later, you can check for the presence of the chardet module with a simple
   if statement.

   if chardet:
     # do somehting
   else:
     # continue anyway

   Another common use of the ImportError exception is when two modules implement
   a common application programming interface (API), but one is more desirable
   than the other. (Maybe it's faster or uses less memory) You can try to import
   one module but fall back to a different module if the first import fails.

   
** Unbound Variables
    If we take another look at our approximate_size() function there is a
    variable that never gets declared.

    multiple = 1024 if a_kilobyte_is_1024_bytes else 1000

    You never declare the variable multiple; you just assign a value to it.
    And with Python, that's ok, because python lets you do that. Python, however,
    does not let you reference a variable that has never been assigned a value;
    trying to do so will raise a NameError exception.

    
** Running Scripts
   Python modules are objects and have several useful attributes. One of these
   attributes makes it easy to test your modules as you write them by including
   a special block of code that executes when you run the python file on the
   command line.

   So if we look at the last few lines of our approximate_size() function there
   is an if statement there. All modules have a built-in attribute __name__.
   A modules __name__ depends on how you're using the module. If you import
   the module, __name__ is the module's file name without a directory path or
   file extension.

   >>> import humansize
   >>> humansize.__name__
   'humansize'

   
   But you can also run the module directly as a standalone program, in which
   case __name__ will be a special default vaule: __main__. Python will
   evaluate this if statement, find a true expression, and execute the if code
   block. As you can see when you run the script the __main__ block prints
   two values.
