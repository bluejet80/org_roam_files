Learning is all about repition over time.

If your mind is repeatedly exposed to something. Then after
a while it naturally gets ingrained within the mind and
easy to recall and relate to other things.

I am thinking about how to make a template of the central index
buffer. I thought about making a table with the words for the
various topics in it, and putting it at the top of each tramplate
so then you can make a new heading and put it in a category too.

I made the mega-emacs with the cress divided into three sections
in one window. Its nice.

The [[id:5ecfd482-a98f-4eab-b842-f6b00428090b][Program journal]] is a very important piece of writing. There
is much opportunity in studying it.

I wanted to set up a thing where everyday at a certain time I would
just write down what I was thinking about at that time. It would
be a cool study. And it would give me more a sense of obligation
to a behavior, or routine. See what it is like to disrupt your
routine a little.
