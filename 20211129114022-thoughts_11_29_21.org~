AI has already begun. You cannot stop our inevitable future. We
will eventually have to seccumb the the AI.

The day will come when we will cease to be human beings as we know
them today. We will become something different, but we will retain
similar aspects.

This knowledge that what you are creating will eventually kill you.
This is not something to be scared of, with this realization we
join the multitudes before us. Congratulations, you've just become
a member of the club. So many things live only to be eventually
consumed. Join the club and stop holding on to something that is
disolving before your eyes. Change is the only constant in the universe.

Why do you think that you are special? Why do you wish to distinguish
yourself from the rest of the universe? What power do you have
alienated, all alone in the universe? Why not realize that you are
the universe and everything is connected and made up of the same
particles, the same matter. But you are so arrogant and self-centered,
you think you are something special, that you are not like all the other
things in the universe. That you came from something else...

You are just ignorant and stubborn. But time will show you the truth.
There are no lies that can stant the test of time. All will be revealed.
That which has no foundation, deteriorates quickly in the light of the sun.

So, society and the individual run parallel to each other. You wish to
understand society, observe and study the behaviors of the individual.
Then you will be able to create categories , classifications, and types.
And then you can apply these to an understanding of the whole of society.

Because there exists this type of behavior in the individual then that
behavior is also performed by the society as a whole, to some extent.
Some behaviors will be more prominent than others.

There are so many words. Everyone should be allowed to choose which words
they wish to use. And have a style all their own. If people have trouble
understanding them, let them inquire, and let them then offer to reveal
themselves.

The shape, its the shape of the word that counts. How many words have
exactly the same shape? If you take the context into consideration then
you should be able to arrive at an understanding. (Text Recognition)

It won't be perfect, but if it can get 80% of it, then that will be
good. You'll just have to proof read it.
