* GitHub Verson Control
  
** I need to make the whole git flow a habit within my work flow.
   To do this I need to setup, or establish within my mind a logical
   process that I will go through for each and every project. This
   doesn't happen only at the beginning but it is a perpetual thing
   throughout the life of the project, all projects. 

** Git Commands to know

    Go to the google docs index page for that journal and make
    sure that it is properly formatted

*** Copy the text into the coreect javascript file. 

*** Use the Python Script to create the JSON object within the file

*** Copy the necessary elements from the old javascript file
    Then change the names of the variables with in the file to match the
    name of the current journal

*** Rename the main webpage for the journal.
    Go into the page and change all the names to reflect the current journal.
    Edit the number of links to match the number necessary for the number of
    pages included in the present journal.

    Make sure the page is all ready to go before you copy it. 
    
*** Copy the main page into all the linked pages necessary
    
*** Process the Images in lightroom
    Export the odd pages first, then run the script to change the file names
    Copy them into the images directory
    Export the even pages, then run the script to change the file names
    Copy them in to the image directory

*** Make sure the right cover image is in the directory

*** Add the link to the Index page for the website
