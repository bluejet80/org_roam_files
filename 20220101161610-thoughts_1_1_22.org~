Think about before television and before microphones and
recording. The position that a musical performer had in society
was very different then.

Its new years day.
Last night was a rollercoaster of fun chaos. I was up until 4am.
I was over at Tim house and just like normal, every holiday tends
to get a lil crazy. I couldnt stop laughing, I took my violin over
there. That was the first time that I had played my violin in a while.
It went pretty good. The violin seems to be much easier to play then the
viola just because its smaller.

Its 4:24pm now and Im still not quite back to normal.
It's 9 degrees outside. There was ice and a lil bit of snow last night.
I had to help bruce put up these storm windows, my hands were about
to fall off. So cold.

Norma is becoming harder to deal with. Bruce is under a lot of stress
right now. I try to do what I can to watch norma. But it is still
very hard on him.
